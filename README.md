## Installation

    $ npm install onoff

If you're using Node.js v4 or higher and seeing lots of compile errors when
installing onoff, it's very likely that gcc/g++ 4.8 or higher are not
installed. See
[Node.js v4 and native addons](https://github.com/fivdi/onoff/wiki/Node.js-v4-and-native-addons)
for details.

If you're using Node.js v0.10.29 on the Raspberry Pi and seeing a compile
error saying that `‘REPLACE_INVALID_UTF8’ is not a member of ‘v8::String’`
see [Node.js v0.10.29 and native addons on the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/fivdi/onoff/wiki/Node.js-v0.10.29-and-native-addons-on-the-Raspberry-Pi).

If you're using Node.js v0.10.29 on the BeagleBone Black and seeing a compile
error saying that `‘REPLACE_INVALID_UTF8’ is not a member of ‘v8::String’`
see [Node.js v0.10.29 and native addons on the BeagleBone Black](https://github.com/fivdi/onoff/wiki/Node.js-v0.10.29-and-native-addons-on-the-BeagleBone-Black).

If upon `npm install` command you get a continuous stream of `WARN EACCESS` messages complaining about `attempting to reinstall using temporary dev dir "....../node_modules/onoff/node_modules/epoll/.node-gyp"`, it's a well known issue with the `node-gyp` dependency that's well documented here: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/454

The workaround is to use the `--unsafe-perm` param in the install command:

    $ npm install --unsafe-perm onoff


## Usage

Assume that there's an LED on GPIO #17 and a momentary push button on GPIO #4.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivdi/onoff/master/examples/light-switch.png">

When the button is pressed the LED should turn on, when it's released the LED
should turn off. This can be achieved with the following code:

```js
var Gpio = require('onoff').Gpio,
  led = new Gpio(17, 'out'),
  button = new Gpio(4, 'in', 'both');

button.watch(function(err, value) {
  led.writeSync(value);
});
```

Here two Gpio objects are being created. One called led for the LED on GPIO #17
which is an output, and one called button for the momentary push button on
GPIO #4 which is an input. In addition to specifying that the button is an
input, the constructors optional third argument is used to specify that 'both'
rising and falling interrupt edges should be configured for the button GPIO as
both button presses and releases should be handled.

After everything has been setup correctly, the buttons watch method is used to
specify a callback function to execute every time the button is pressed or
released. The value argument passed to the callback function represents the
state of the button which will be 1 for pressed and 0 for released. This value
is used by the callback to turn the LED on or off using its writeSync method.

When the above program is running it can be terminated with ctrl-c. However,
it doesn't free its resources. It also ignores the err argument passed to
the callback. Here's a slightly modified variant of the program that handles
ctrl-c gracefully and bails out on error. The resources used by the led and
button Gpio objects are released by calling their unexport method.

```js
var Gpio = require('onoff').Gpio,
  led = new Gpio(17, 'out'),
  button = new Gpio(4, 'in', 'both');

button.watch(function (err, value) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  led.writeSync(value);
});

process.on('SIGINT', function () {
  led.unexport();
  button.unexport();
});
```

## How does onoff work?

Internally onoff uses sysfs files located at /sys/class/gpio to access GPIOs
and the [epoll package](https://github.com/fivdi/epoll) to detect hardware
interrupts. The Linux GPIO sysfs interface for userspace is documented
[here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/gpio/sysfs.txt).
It's a relatively simple interface which can be used to ask the Linux kernel
to export control of a GPIO to userspace. After control of a GPIO has been
exported to userspace, the GPIO can be configured as an input or output.
Thereafter, the state of an input can be read, and the state of an output can
be written. Some systems will also allow the state of a output to be read.
The GPIO sysfs interface can also be used for interrupt detection. onoff can
detect several thousand interrupts per second on both the BeagleBone and the
Raspberry Pi.

##### Gpio(gpio, direction [, edge] [, options])
- gpio - An unsigned integer specifying the GPIO number.
- direction - A string specifying whether the GPIO should be configured as an
input or output. The valid values are: 'in', 'out', 'high', and 'low'. If 'out'
is specified the GPIO will be configured as an output and the value of the GPIO
will be set to 0. 'high' and 'low' are variants of 'out' that configure the
GPIO as an output with an initial level of 1 or 0 respectively.
- [edge] - An optional string specifying the interrupt generating edge or
edges for a GPIO input. The valid values are: 'none', 'rising', 'falling' or
'both'. The default value is 'none' indicating that the GPIO does not generate
interrupts. On Linux kernels prior to 3.13 it was possible for both inputs
and outputs to generate interrupts. The 3.13 kernel dropped support for
interrupt generating outputs, irrespective of whether the underlying hardware
supports them or not.
- [options] - An optional options object.

Returns a new Gpio object that can be used to access a GPIO.

The following options are supported:
- activeLow - A boolean value specifying whether the values read from or
written to the GPIO should be inverted. The interrupt generating edge for the
GPIO also follow this this setting. The valid values for activeLow are true
and false. Setting activeLow to true inverts. Optional, the default value is
false.

GPIOs on Linux are identified by unsigned integers. These are the numbers that
should be passed to the onoff Gpio constructor function when exporting GPIOs
to userspace. For example, pin 8 on the Raspberry Pi P1 expansion header
corresponds to GPIO #17 in Raspbian Linux. 17 is therefore the number to pass
to the onoff Gpio constructor when using pin 8 on the P1 expansion header.

##### read([callback])
- [callback] - An optional completion callback that gets two arguments (err,
value), where err is reserved for an error object and value is the number 0
or 1 and represents the state of the GPIO.

Read GPIO value asynchronously.

Note that most systems support readback of GPIOs configured as outputs. The
read method can therefore be called for any GPIO, irrespective of whether it
was configured as an input or an output. The Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone are
examples of such systems.

##### readSync()
Read GPIO value synchronously. Returns the number 0 or 1 to represent the
state of the GPIO.

Note that most systems support readback of GPIOs configured as outputs. The
readSync method can therefore be called for any GPIO, irrespective of whether
it was configured as an input or an output. The Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone
are examples of such systems.

##### write(value[, callback])
- value - The number 0 or 1.
- [callback] - An optional completion callback that gets one argument (err),
where err is reserved for an error object.

Write GPIO value asynchronously.

##### writeSync(value)
- value - The number 0 or 1.

Write GPIO value synchronously.

##### watch(callback)
- callback - A callback that gets two arguments (err, value), where err is
reserved for an error object and value is the number 0 or 1 and represents the
state of the GPIO. The value can also be used to determine whether the
interrupt occurred on a rising or falling edge. A value of 0 implies a falling
edge interrupt and a value of 1 implies a rising edge interrupt.

Watch for hardware interrupts on the GPIO. The edge argument that was passed
to the constructor determines which hardware interrupts to watch for.

##### unwatch([callback])
- [callback] - The callback to remove.

Stop watching for hardware interrupts on the GPIO. If callback is specified,
only that particular callback is removed. Otherwise all callbacks are removed.

##### unwatchAll()
Remove all hardware interrupt watchers for the GPIO.

##### direction()
Returns the string 'in' or 'out' indicating whether the GPIO is an input or
output.

##### setDirection(direction)
- direction - A string specifying whether the GPIO should be configured as an
input or output. The valid values are 'in' and 'out'.

Set GPIO direction.

##### edge()
Returns the string 'none', 'falling', 'rising', or 'both' indicating the
interrupt generating edge or edges for the GPIO.

##### setEdge(edge)
- edge - A string specifying the interrupt generating edge or edges for the
GPIO. The valid values are: 'none', 'rising', 'falling' or 'both'. On Linux
kernels prior to 3.13 it was possible for both inputs and outputs to generate
interrupts. The 3.13 kernel dropped support for interrupt generating outputs,
irrespective of whether the underlying hardware supports them or not.

Set GPIO interrupt generating edge.

##### activeLow()
Returns true or false indicating whether or not the values read from or written
to the GPIO are inverted.

##### setActiveLow(invert)
- invert - A boolean value specifying whether the values read from or written
to the GPIO should be inverted. The interrupt generating edge for the GPIO also
follow this this setting. The valid values for invert are true and false.
Setting activeLow to true inverts. Optional, the default value is false.

Set GPIO activeLow setting.

##### unexport()
Reverse the effect of exporting the GPIO to userspace. A Gpio object should not
be used after calling its unexport method.

### Synchronous API

Blink the LED on GPIO #17 for 5 seconds:

```js
var Gpio = require('onoff').Gpio, // Constructor function for Gpio objects.
  led = new Gpio(17, 'out'),      // Export GPIO #17 as an output.
  iv;

// Toggle the state of the LED on GPIO #17 every 200ms.
// Here synchronous methods are used. Asynchronous methods are also available.
iv = setInterval(function () {
  led.writeSync(led.readSync() ^ 1); // 1 = on, 0 = off :)
}, 200);

// Stop blinking the LED and turn it off after 5 seconds.
setTimeout(function () {
  clearInterval(iv); // Stop blinking
  led.writeSync(0);  // Turn LED off.
  led.unexport();    // Unexport GPIO and free resources
}, 5000);
```

### Asynchronous API

Blink the LED on GPIO #17 for 5 seconds:

```js
var Gpio = require('onoff').Gpio, // Constructor function for Gpio objects.
  led = new Gpio(17, 'out');      // Export GPIO #17 as an output.

// Toggle the state of the LED on GPIO #17 every 200ms 'count' times.
// Here asynchronous methods are used. Synchronous methods are also available.
(function blink(count) {
  if (count <= 0) {
    return led.unexport();
  }

  led.read(function (err, value) { // Asynchronous read.
    if (err) {
      throw err;
    }

    led.write(value ^ 1, function (err) { // Asynchronous write.
      if (err) {
        throw err;
      }
    });
  });

  setTimeout(function () {
    blink(count - 1);
  }, 200);
}(25));
```

## Configuring pullup and pulldown resistors

On the Raspberry Pi, most GPIOs have either their pull-up or pull-down resistor
activated by default. The defaults can be seen in Table 6-31 on pages 102 and
103 of the
[BCM2835 ARM Peripherals](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1521578.pdf)
documentation.

Pullup and pulldown resistors for GPIOs can be configured with device tree
overlays. The Wiki page
[Enabling Pullup and Pulldown Resistors on The Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/fivdi/onoff/wiki/Enabling-Pullup-and-Pulldown-Resistors-on-The-Raspberry-Pi)
describes how this can be achieved on the Raspberry Pi.

## Benchmarks

Three of the onoff tests are used to monitor performance:

  * performance-async.js - determine max. no. of write ops per seconds
  * performance-sync.js - determine max. no. of writeSync ops per second
  * performance-interrupt.js - determine max. no. of interrupts per second

The average of ten runs of these tests using various versions of Node.js

Tested on the following platforms:

- Raspberry Pi 1, 2 and 3
  - Raspbian
- C.H.I.P.
  - Debian
- BeagleBone and BeagleBone Black
  - Debian

The suitability of onoff for a particular Linux board is highly dependent on
how GPIO interfaces are made available on that board. The
[GPIO interfaces](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/gpio/)
documentation describes GPIO access conventions rather than standards that must
be followed so GPIO can vary from platform to platform. For example, onoff
relies on sysfs files located at /sys/classes/gpio being available. However,
these sysfs files for userspace GPIO are optional and may not be available on a
particular platform.
